# mindpal-recruitment-task

Hi! One of the requirements of this task was to not use any framework so I let myself use a Typescript,SCSS and Webpack which are not technically frameworks so I hope you won't hold a grudge :D

Additionally I uploaded project to GH Pages so it's easier to check how the app works:

If you want to start project locally, all you need to do is:

- npm i
- npm run dev
